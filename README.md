# iOS Tip-Calculator Demo: "Tip Tally"
This is an iOS tip calculator app called "Tip Tally". This project was created following the [tip calculator tutorial](https://vimeo.com/102084767) by Tim Lee and the [CodePath](http://codepath.com/) team.

##### Time Spent: 
6 hours

##### Completed user stories:
- [x] follow the video instructions to create a basic tip calculator
- [x] add custom design (including but not limited to custom icon, launch image, background color, animation etc.)

##### Notes:
This was a fun project. I got hung up on a few areas including getting the proper launch image to show as well as getting the proper animations to work. I decided to leave out the animations as I ultimately preferred the experience without them. With that said I look forward to learning more about Swift animations in future projects.
